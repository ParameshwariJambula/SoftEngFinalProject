# About

The project aims to develop a web-based platform titled "Creating a Web-Based Platform for Course Resource Library". This platform targets students and learners, providing them with an interactive interface to access educational resources, manage their profiles, and engage in course-related activities. The project's primary objective is to offer students hands-on experience in website development while addressing the specific needs of educational management and user interaction within the platform. 

## Features

- **User Roles:** The system supports three user roles: Admin, Teacher, and Student. Each role has specific functionalities and access levels.
- **Admin Dashboard:** Administrators can add new students and teachers, create classes and subjects, manage user accounts, and oversee system settings.
- **Attendance Tracking:** Teachers can easily take attendance for their classes, mark students as present or absent, and generate attendance reports.
- **Performance Assessment:** Teachers can assess students' performance by providing marks and feedback. Students can view their marks and track their progress over time.
- **Data Visualization:** Students can visualize their performance data through interactive charts and tables, helping them understand their academic performance at a glance.
- **Communication:** Users can communicate effortlessly through the system. Teachers can send messages to students and vice versa, promoting effective communication and collaboration.
